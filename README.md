Project for CS 521 Information Structures with Python. 

Name: Simple BMI Calculator

Description: Command-line application that asks user to input their gender, age, height, current weight, goal weight, and activity level. Based on user input, the program calculates the body mass index (BMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), and the caloric intake necessary to achieve weight loss, gain, or maintenance. The caloric intake goal is determined by the BMI and is calculated for a weight loss or gain of 2lbs a week as recommended by health professionals. Once it has been shown whether the user needs to gain, lose or maintain weight, the program will list three tips to help the user towards their goal.
